# This file is the main config for the mailad provision scripts

### Target Domain
# This is the FQDN of the domain
#
DOMAIN=mailad.cu

### Mail server's names
# This is the full quialified distinguished name of the PC
# you pretend to deploy the script
#
# The config points are /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts
# if they are not configured properly you will get a
# warning
#
HOSTNAME=mail.mailad.cu

### Real mail account of the mail administrator
# This is a requirement in the RFC as postmaster @ abuse
# address must point to a valid address an we use that
#
# You will receive all sort of warnings, errors and
# other notifications from the mail server, you can use
# a specific address for this and another for your
# personal us
#
ADMINMAIL=pavelmc@mailad.cu

### Sysadmin list
# If you have more than one sysadmin or a team that take turns
# to work, then you want to get them via a group and not only
# to the ADMINMAIL configured above
#
# Set the group email you want to use in the var below if you
# want to enable that feature, be aware that you need to create
# the group for it to work (you will recieve remainders)
#
# See the Features.md file for more details [SysAdmins part]
#
# By default this options is empty
#
SYSADMINS=""

### Background Copy Carbon
# If you set an address here that account will receive a copy
# of all mails passing by for monitoring purposes, yes
# that's a law requirement in Cuba
#
# Let if blank if you dna't need that
#
# If will use this feature, please create the account before
# hand as it will start to receive mails from the start
#
ALWAYSBCC=

### Max size of the emails
# In MBytes, it will be calculated in bytes inside, the
# calculations have a 8% margin for headers and attachments
# expansion to be safe
#
MESSAGESIZE=2

### My Networks
# This are the IP or networks that are fully trusted by the server, 
# beside localhost & 127.0.0.1 that are already covered and you
# don't need to put them here
#
# Any PC with an IP in this range can send email without password auth
# and without restrictions, even to the outside world, this is useful
# for DMZ status mails from other servers via plain SMTP, or to receive
# emails from the mail gateway
# 
# NEVER put the user's network here, NEVER!
#
# Use "quotes" around it and separe multiple entries with a comma and
# space, like this "10.0.0.0/24, 172.16.0.0/27"
#
# WARINING!: If you have a webmail (roundcube/rainloop/horde/etc)
# be aware that if the IP of the the webmail falls under the net
# segment declared here it will bypass all resctrictions, ALL
# RESTRICTIONS!
#
# To exclude one or more IPs from a subnet you can use the '!' operator
# for example to exclude the IP 192.168.1.5 from the 192.168.1.0/27
# range you can put it like this:
#
# "!192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.0/27"
#
# You can use more than one IP, but exclusions must be declared before
# the network segment, not before
#
MYNETWORK="10.42.0.0/29"

### Mail Gateway or SmartHost
# If you have a mail gateway between you and the internet or if you
# are in a national/global enterprise network and need to deliver
# to a specific mail server for relaying to the outside world, then
# you must set this to that ip
#
# Use "[]" around it if it's and IP
# 
# If your deliver the mails directly to the destination servers
# leave it blank
#
# Proxmox Mail Gateway note: remember that PMG uses port 26 for the
# outgoing mails, to append ":26" to the IP or hostname
#
RELAY=

### Mail user owner
# As we use a virtual mailbox domain we need a user to be the
# owner of all the mails, usually you don't need touch this
#
VMAILNAME=vmail
VMAILUID=5000
VMAILGID=5000

### Local mail storage
# This is the folder that will hold the mailbox folders for the users
# you can mount this as another partition, a NFS share, etc.
# 
# If you use a networks mount point be aware of the id mappings
#
# Our advice is to make it work with a local folder first, then
# stop the services and mount the share 
#
VMAILSTORAGE="/home/vmail"

### Domain Master
# This is the IP of the Active Directory Domain Controller, we will
# bind to this IP via ldap (not secure, see AD_Requirements.md)
# to validate users and get details about them
#
HOSTAD=dc.mailad.cu

### SSL/TLS for LDAP communications
# Select whether SSL/TLS will be used with LDAP communications
#
# Samba 4 AD can use SSL/TLS out of the box but Windows AD can't
# for this reason the default will be NOT to use a security layer
# for ldap communications.
#
# If you use a Windows AD and want to use SSL/TLS please read the
# correspoding entry on the Features.md file for instructions
#
# Set it to "yes" if you use SAMBA 4 as the AD DC
# Set it to "no" if you use Windows AD DC
#
# options: yes/no (default no, case matters!)
SECURELDAP=no

### AD LDAP user bind credentials
# As we need to search and validate against the AD, we use a set of
# fixed credentials to bind to it, se AD_Requirements.md
#
# This is a normal user, not and admin, no extra priv are needed
# just make it sure you checked the "Account never expires" flag
#
# Please don't use this Password, CHANGE IT!
#
LDAPBINDUSER="cn=linux,cn=Users,dc=mailad,dc=cu"
LDAPBINDPASSWD="Passw0rd---"

### Base DN
# This is the LDAP path to the OU that holds the users data, any user
# outside this OU will be ignored by the mail server
#
LDAPSEARCHBASE="ou=MAILAD,dc=mailad,dc=cu"

### Enterprise data to generate a Self-Signed-Certificate
# This steps is mandatory, even if you has a valid cert, you can
# update them at the end (see README.md)
#
# The Self-Signed-Certificate is generated to las 3 years, if you
# need to renew it, just run `rm certs && make certs`  
#
SSLPAIS="CU"
SSLESTADO="Camaguey"
SSLCIUDAD="Camaguey"
SSLEMPRESA="MailAD"
SSLUEB="Nodo Central"
SSLHOSTNAME=`hostname -f`

### Everyone account
# In some cases you need an aliases that covers all the mail
# account registered on the server, some mail servers call it
# the everyone account, here you can name it as your need
#
# Plase set it like this example, let the @$DOMAIN part, just
# change the everyone part
#
#EVERYONE="todos@mailad.cu"
#
# If you don't need this leave it blank like this
#
EVERYONE=""

### Make the everyone address accessible from outside
# The address you set as the everyone alias by defaults is not
# accesible from the outside world as a security measure
#
# That means it only works inside your domain, if you need to
# be hable to use it from the outside se this to "yes"
#
# options: yes/no (default no, case matters!)
EVERYONE_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_ACCESS=no

### Dovecot sieve filtering
# Per user mail filtering is enabled by default
#
# If you enable this feature all mails marked as SPAM will be
# automatically moved to the Trash Folder up on reception
#
# Please keep in mind that a user using POP3 (discouraged)
# may never see that message, to enable the filter and avoid
# the mentioned quirk, please stop using POP3 and use IMAP
# instead
#
# options: yes/no (case matters!)
SPAM_FILTER_ENABLED=no

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING VARIABLE
CONFVER=3
